Junior Computer Engineering Student @ NYU, Enjoys programming and contributing to open source software

### More Information

I like computers, watching How It's Made, and riding a bicycle. I actually do study at NYU Abu Dhabi, and I started an open source [indoor farming project](http://reimagine.farm/) there (open source in terms of both hardware and software). So, CSCI-UA 480 seemed like a good course for me to understand open source philosophy and properly implement it to my project. Also, I needed a computer engineering elective, and CSCI-UA 480 satisfies that requirement as well.
