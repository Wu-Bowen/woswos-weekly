title: "Week 7: Deciding on our final project"
excerpt: "We are very close to actually contributing to open source projects! <br> 3, 2, 1, 0...All engines running! Lift-off! We have a lift-off!"

Before finalizing our final project decisions, we spent some time on understanding the difference between merge and rebase options of git. I have never heard of rebasing, and I had no idea about rebasing before this tutorial. Now, I know that I can use rebasing to keep my commit history clean while avoiding merge conflicts.

The git visualization we used in the class was also helpful. I sometimes use ```git status``` command to track the commits, but it is not easy to follow what is going on through lines of text, at least for me. A visualization tool like the one we used in the class would be great to have for actual git repositories as well.

*When a feature branch's development is complete, rebase all the work down to the minimum number of meaningful commits and avoid creating a merge commit. This way, code history remains flat and readable.  <br>(Source: [Hackernoon](https://web.archive.org/web/20200315130854/https://hackernoon.com/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a){:target="_blank"})*


### 3, 2, 1, 0...All engines running! Lift-off! We have a lift-off!
This week we learned our group assignments for the final project. After a brief introduction within our group, we discussed which project to choose, and we agreed on contributing to [Jupyter Interactive Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook){:target=" _blank"}. It is a project that we all knew about and had some experience. We also heard that the community is very welcoming to new contributors. So, Jupyter seemed like the best option for our group. We agreed to meet after the class on Wednesdays to discuss our progress on the project.

Later, we *tried* installing the development environment for the Jupyter Interactive Notebook, and we all encountered different errors at different points of the installation process. It took a while to figure out the problems and complete the installation. Now, we are ready to contribute to Jupyter Interactive Notebook and have some lift-off! &#x2B0E;
